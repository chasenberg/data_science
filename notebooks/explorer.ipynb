    "* This notebook is intended to demonstrate basic techniques of formatting a dataset and gaining simple insights.  The term business demography is used here to cover a group of variables which explain the characteristics and demography of the business population. The creation of new enterprises and the closure of unproductive businesses can be seen as an important contributor to business dynamism. In addition to studying the population of active enterprises, the counts and characteristics of enterprise births and deaths are examined. \n",
